              Is This a Sequel?
                Yes. This is Super Meat Boy 2, but with a less boring name than “Super
              Meat Boy 2”.

              What’s Different?
                 Let’s start with what’s the same: Dr. Fetus is still a jerk, gameplay
              is super challenging but fair, there are tightcontrols and great levels
              and you will die...a lot.
                 Now what’s different: Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have a little baby
              named Nugget (awww). Dr Fetus has kidnapped Nugget,forcing Meat Boy and
              Bandage Girl to rescue her. Levels are dynamically constructed based on
              difficulty. Each time you beat a level, it reconstructs into a harder
              version of itself (up to a point...we aren’t gods). Meat Boy and Bandage
              Girl are no longer defenseless, they can punch and kick their enemies.
              And, the biggest difference, the controls controls are now two buttons,
              you have a jump, a jump attack, a dive, and a slide.

              Two Buttons? That Sounds Dumb!
                 Here’s the thing: shut up. Two buttons doesn’t mean less control,
              it means we designed levels to use two buttons. You can get a surprising
              amount of movement and precision by designing levels that complement your
              controls. Super Meat Boy felt great because there was a marriage of level
              design and controls, Super Meat Boy Forever is no different.

              Is This an Infinite-Runner?
                 No, Super Meat Boy Forever’s levels have a defined start and end, no
              infinite running. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl doalways run though, if some
              one kidnapped your kid you’d run all the time too.

              the levels to be presented as.
              Can I speedrun it?
              Yep! We'll have SKIPZ™ AND SICK TECH™ so don't worry your fidget spinners.
              When Is It Coming Out?
              We are shooting for April 2019 for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Playstation
             4 and Epic Games Store and April 2020 for Steam.
