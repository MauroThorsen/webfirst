                  ExpressVPN is a virtual private network service offered by the British
              Virgin Islands-based company Express VPN International Ltd.[1] The software
              is marketed as a privacy and security tool that encrypts users’ web traffic and
              masks their IP addresses.
                 In July 2017, ExpressVPN announced in an open letter that Apple had remo
              ved all VPN apps from its App Store in China, arevelation that was later pi
              cked up by The New York Times and other outlets.[8][9][10] In response to
              questions from U.S. Senators, Apple stated it had removed 674 VPN Apps from
              the App Store in China in 2017 at the request of the Chinese government.

                  In December 2017, ExpressVPN came into the spotlight in relation to the
              investigation of the assassination of Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei
              Karlov. Turkish investigators seized an ExpressVPN server which they say was
              used to delete relevant information from the assassin’s Gmail and Facebook
              accounts.[12][13] Turkish authorities were unable to find any logs to aid actions
              their investigation, which the company said verified its claim that it did
              not store user activity or connection logs, adding; "while it’s unfortunate
               that security tools like VPNs can be abused for illicit purposes, they are
               critical for our safety and the preservation of our right to privacy online.
               ExpressVPN is fundamentally opposed to any efforts to install 'backdoors'
               or attempts by governments to otherwise undermine such technologies."
