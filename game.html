                                At the beginning, it was a flash game. Later, team meat developed it into a platform-wide game that made you die again and again. It is difficult to change because it is really difficult.
                                <br> PS: The playback function of the game is particularly interesting. After you complete a level, you will play the track of your dead meat.</p>

                                When I first came into contact with this game, I was embarrassed. 2D's weird style, simple operation, random maps, changing seasons, changing day and night. The content of the game is that a scientist is sent to the strange world to cut grass, cut trees,
                                open up land, plant, build, explore, hunt, survive as much as possible. For a long time, you can unlock more protagonists with special abilities.</p>

                                Ok, this kind of digging and digging game I am not too cold, but many people are crazy about it, 2D version of Minecraft. Digging, synthesizing, building. These words are enough to summarize such games, but the bird statue engine and circuit construction
                                in the game has improved the level of the game a lot, full of technology, let me have the feeling of "this is steampunk."s</p>

                                The game was also a flash at first, but it was released on steam. As a person who doesn't like tower defense, I feel that this game is absolutely perfect. One is the cartoon style picture, and the other is the game mechanic. This game is not to build
                                a tower, the tower to attack, but to build a tower, towers to build soldiers, control the soldiers to attack. Like other tower defenses, you can upgrade towers and have special skills.</p>
